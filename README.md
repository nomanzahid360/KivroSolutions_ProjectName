## 🚀 Tasks Overview

### 🧩 **Task 1 – Number Guessing Game**
A simple game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.  
Demonstrates:
- Random number generation  
- Loops and conditionals  
- User input validation  

---

### 🎓 **Task 2 – Simple Student Grade Calculator**
A program that allows the user to input a student’s name and marks for three subjects.  
It calculates the **total marks**, **average**, and assigns a **grade (A, B, C, D, or F)** based on the average.  
Demonstrates:
- Use of **functions** for modular design  
- **Arithmetic operations** and conditional logic  
- **Formatted output** for clean display  

---

### ✅ **Task 3 – Simple To-Do List App**
A menu-based Python program that allows users to **add, view, and delete tasks** from a to-do list.  
It uses a loop so the program continues running until the user chooses to exit.  
Demonstrates:
- **List operations** for storing tasks  
- **Loops and menus** for continuous interaction  
- **Functions** for better structure and readability  

---

### 🔒 **Task 4 – Simple Password Validator**
A Python program that validates passwords based on specific rules to ensure basic security.  
The user can test multiple passwords until choosing to exit.  
Demonstrates:
- **String operations** (`isdigit()`, `isupper()`, `len()`)  
- **Conditional logic** for multiple checks  
- **Loops and functions** for clean validation flow
